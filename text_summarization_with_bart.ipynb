As I was just told it did during check in. Oh, and this is a non smoking hotel/ facility. Yet, idk if this place has been cleaning since the 1950s. I think I might need to have my lungs checked after walking through the hallway of Building 3 and 2. Customer Service is a joke. No maintenance at the facility during the evening that they couldn’t fix anything. lights didn’t work. Or their jetted tub, which didn’t work. All the front desk said was, “Ok. And what would you like me to do?” When I offered a typical proper customer service response of possibly a different room that functions properly? Shot down. There is Nobody to fix the problem. But is everything plugged in? Tv was tiny. It’s not like expected service from the Ritz. However, this place is Sleazy 8 with a “suite”! So all in all, if you need a trap Hotel in Vegas This one is Perfect! Conveniently located to the strip and Horrible Customer Service.  Hotel was not clean, extremely run down, and there wasn’t deadlocks on the doors. Does not attract a good crowd. Entire place smells like cigarettes, yet it is not a casino hotel, nor is smoking allowed in this hotel. Was not a pleasant stay. Would not recommend this hotel to anyone. I cut my stay after the first night. OLD rooms badly in need of updating; had to walk across 4 lanes of traffic to get to closest restaurant; however, attractive lobby, TRUE 24-hour shuttle service to airport. The whole experience was NOT worth the $112 week day price. It was good overall for us. Staff and housekeeping were friendly and helpful. Completely run-down and neglected. The ONLY reason I stayed there was because it was cheap - and boy, was it CHEAP and THREADBARE. Looked like absolutely no maintenance since it was built 40 years ago. Probably, the property is slated for demolition and replacement by something huge, new and glossy: so the present owners don't care about anything. It is old and kind of running down. The bathroom has broken tiles the toilet wouldn’t quit running, the beds are old and not comfortable. The deadlock wouldn’t lock. It rained and there was an inch of water on the floor when we got back to our room. Not too good! \"\n",
