<end>', '<start> that s ok . <end>', '<start> hello . i need to find out if a receipt of proceeds has arrived . i m from felix wasserman associates . <end>', '<start> thanks . have you got the l c number ? <end>', '<start> it s nx . <end>', '<start> hang on a tick and i ll check for you . i m sorry we have no record of that arriving . <end>', '<start> ok , thanks for checking . could you give me a ring when it arrives , please ? <end>', '<start> no problem . i ll be in touch as soon as it comes in . <end>', '<start> yes . i have to stay in your cry for just one day , can you suggest a short tour ? <end>', '<start> are you interested in the natural landscape or the human landscape ? <end>', '<start> i would prefer the first one . <end>', '<start> sure . we have a one day trip along the river . it s quite beautiful . <end>', '<start> i need to find out some more information for l c . i would like an outline of responsibilities , both ours , yours and the beneficiary , please . <end>', '<start> ok , to start , the conditions are specified by the buyer and may include insurance forms , way bills , bills of lading , customs forms , various certificates . <end>', '<start> ok , got it . is there anything else i need to know before we go ahead ? <end>', '<start> just that in effect , a basic letter of credit is a financial contract between the bank , the bank s customer , and the beneficiary , and this contract involves the transfer of goods or services against funds . <end>', '<start> that sounds fine , thanks for that . let s go ahead ! <end>', '<start> i would like to report a break in . <end>', '<start> when was this break in ? <end>', '<start> i believe it happened last night . <end>', '<start> where was the break in ? <end>', '<start> it happened at my house . <end>', '<start> was anything stolen ? <end>', '<start> i haven t checked yet . <end>', '<start> why do you think there was a break in ? <end>', '<start> my front window was broken . <end>', '<start> we ll send a squad car shortly . <end>', '<start> i d appreciate that . <end>', '<start> one dollar . <end>', '<start> so , i can have five for five dollars ? <end>', '<start> actually , you can only have four . <end>', '<start> oh , yeah . i forgot tax . give me four then , please . <end>', '<start> okay . thanks . <end>', '<start> come in please . <end>', '<start> good evening , sir . i come to make the bed . shall i do it now or later ?

        "Implement an encoder-decoder model with attention which you can read about in the TensorFlow [Neural Machine Translation (seq2seq) tutorial](https://github.com/tensorflow/nmt). This example uses a more recent set of APIs. This notebook implements the [attention equations](https://github.com/tensorflow/nmt#background-on-the-attention-mechanism) from the seq2seq tutorial. The following diagram shows that each input words is assigned a weight by the attention mechanism which is then used by the decoder to predict the next word in the sentence. The below picture and formulas are an example of attention mechanism from [Luong's paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.04025v5). \n",

Softmax by default is applied on the last axis but here we want to apply it on the *1st axis*, since the shape of score is *(batch_size, max_length, hidden_size)*. `Max_length` is the length of our input. Since we are trying to assign a weight to each input, softmax should be applied on that axis.\n",
